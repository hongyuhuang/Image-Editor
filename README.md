# ANDIE

The objective of the project was to make a non-destructive image editor which you could apply various filter, colour, image and text actions on without it applying to the actual file itself therefore allowing the changes to be able to be reverted.

I mainly implemented the filters, crop and textbox. The implementations of the filter involved learning about convolutions and kernels. The crop and textbox involved using the mouse and inserting text using Java graphics.

This code can be run by downloading the files and running the Andie.java file.

The main improvement to this project I would make would just to refine the overall application more so that it would function better and have less bugs like when importing the image all the actions would apply or anything to do with the mouse selection.
